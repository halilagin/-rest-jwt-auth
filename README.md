# rest-jwt-auth


This project is a copy of https://github.com/szerhusenBC/jwt-spring-security-demo.
Here are the difference.

1. I removed docker style java compilation from pom file
2. the java version is reduced to 8 (it was 11)
3. docker port redirection is 18051 to 8080
4. run the demo with command "mvn spring-boot:run"
